# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a browser plugin that enables users to highlight content on websites and PDFs, take notes connected to those highlights, and manage all their highlights and notes through a web application interface. The plugin aims to provide a seamless reading and research experience by allowing users to annotate digital content with multiple highlighter colors and organize their annotations in a centralized location.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Content Highlighting

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to highlight text on websites and PDFs so that I can mark important information for later reference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects text on a webpage THEN the system SHALL display a highlighting interface
2. WHEN a user selects text in a PDF (including local files) THEN the system SHALL display a highlighting interface
3. WHEN a user applies a highlight THEN the system SHALL persist the highlight across browser sessions
4. WHEN a user revisits a previously highlighted page THEN the system SHALL display all existing highlights
5. IF a webpage content changes THEN the system SHALL attempt to preserve highlights using text anchoring
6. WHEN a user hovers over a highlight THEN the system SHALL display highlight metadata (creation date, color, associated notes)

### Requirement 2: Multi-Color Highlighting System

**User Story:** As a student, I want to use different highlighter colors so that I can categorize different types of information (e.g., definitions, examples, important concepts).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the highlighting interface THEN the system SHALL provide multiple color options
2. WHEN a user selects a color THEN the system SHALL apply that color to the selected text
3. WHEN a user creates highlights THEN the system SHALL remember their last used color as default
4. WHEN a user views highlights THEN the system SHALL display each highlight in its assigned color
5. WHEN a user manages highlights THEN the system SHALL allow filtering and sorting by color

### Requirement 3: Note-Taking and Connection System

**User Story:** As a writer, I want to take notes and connect them to my highlights so that I can capture my thoughts and insights about specific passages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a highlight THEN the system SHALL provide an option to add a note
2. WHEN a user clicks on an existing highlight THEN the system SHALL display any associated notes
3. WHEN a user adds a note to a highlight THEN the system SHALL save the note with timestamp and highlight reference
4. WHEN a user edits a note THEN the system SHALL update the note while preserving edit history
5. WHEN a user deletes a highlight THEN the system SHALL prompt about associated notes and handle accordingly
6. IF a highlight has associated notes THEN the system SHALL provide visual indication on the highlight

### Requirement 4: Web Application and Sidebar Interface

**User Story:** As a knowledge worker, I want a centralized interface to view and manage all my highlights, bookmarks, and notes so that I can efficiently organize and retrieve my research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the web application THEN the system SHALL display an overview of all highlights, bookmarks, and notes
2. WHEN a user accesses the sidebar THEN the system SHALL show highlights and notes for the current page
3. WHEN a user searches in the web app THEN the system SHALL return relevant highlights and notes based on content and metadata
4. WHEN a user organizes content THEN the system SHALL provide tagging, categorization, and folder functionality
5. WHEN a user clicks on a highlight in the web app THEN the system SHALL navigate to the original source location
6. WHEN a user exports data THEN the system SHALL provide export options in common formats (JSON, CSV, PDF)

### Requirement 5: Cross-Platform Synchronization

**User Story:** As a multi-device user, I want my highlights and notes to sync across all my devices so that I can access my research anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates content on one device THEN the system SHALL sync to all connected devices
2. WHEN a user is offline THEN the system SHALL queue changes for sync when connection is restored
3. WHEN sync conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution options
4. WHEN a user logs in on a new device THEN the system SHALL download and display all existing content
5. IF sync fails THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide retry options

### Requirement 6: Data Privacy and Security

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want my highlights and notes to be secure and private so that my research and thoughts remain confidential.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user stores data THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information
2. WHEN a user accesses the service THEN the system SHALL require secure authentication
3. WHEN a user requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL completely remove all associated data
4. WHEN the system processes data THEN it SHALL comply with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
5. IF a security breach occurs THEN the system SHALL notify users and provide remediation steps

### Requirement 7: Performance and Compatibility

**User Story:** As a browser user, I want the plugin to work smoothly without slowing down my browsing experience so that I can highlight content without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin loads THEN it SHALL not increase page load time by more than 200ms
2. WHEN a user highlights content THEN the action SHALL complete within 100ms
3. WHEN the plugin runs THEN it SHALL be compatible with major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
4. WHEN processing large documents THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance
5. IF the plugin encounters errors THEN it SHALL fail gracefully without breaking the host page
6. WHEN memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL optimize and clean up resources
